\begin{abstract}
We study private watermarking for autoregressive language models, where a provider embeds a key-dependent statistical signal during decoding and later verifies provenance using a secret key.
We introduce \emph{Gaussian Pancakes Watermarking with Salted Phase} (GPW-SP), a lightweight sampling-time method that biases token selection via a smooth periodic function of token embedding projections onto a secret direction.
To reduce predictability, GPW-SP incorporates a context-dependent salted phase derived from a keyed pseudorandom function, producing position-varying preferences without modifying model weights.

GPW-SP is implemented as a modular logits-bias component compatible with standard decoding schemes and evaluated using calibrated hypothesis testing at low false positive rates.
In a GPT-2 pilot on C4 prompts, phase salting substantially improves clean detectability over an unsalted variant (AUC $0.964$ vs.\ $0.878$, TPR@1\%FPR $0.70$ vs.\ $0.28$).
Under meaning-preserving edits, detectability degrades smoothly, remaining robust to moderate synonym replacement and word deletion, while stronger paraphrasing and text mixing significantly reduce detection power.

Overall, GPW-SP provides an efficient geometry-based watermark baseline and a reproducible evaluation protocol aligned with recent watermarking benchmarks, reporting robustness curves under transformations.
