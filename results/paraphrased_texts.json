The link cannot support higher bandwidths because of the different technologies required. A higher bandwidth optical link can't be formed because the link can't support enough light. In optical transmission systems, mechanical link systems are used to transfer power and high forces. A loss in transmission efficiency is caused by high forces and vibrations. Some optical links have shown high rates of transmission loss due to mechanical link systems. High rates of transmission loss and high rates of failure have been shown by optical links.

The fuel-saving engines could help conserve energy. Hughes Aircraft built the Challenger nuclear submarine that reached its peak 2,200 kilometres from the launch site in Cape Canaveral, Florida. By comparing it with a modern submarine ship that is used to ferry nuclear submarines up to 230 kilometers off the coast of the United States and back to the US. The coast guard, Boeing and Dynarink found that they were using an American-made terminal energy system.
